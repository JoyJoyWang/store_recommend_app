# Recommendation Web App

## Overview

This project provides a web-based application to compare and test different recommendation algorithms conveniently. The platform enables users to evaluate key metrics such as click-through rate (CTR) and conversion rate. It is designed for ease of use, allowing users to simply update the `recommendation.py` file with new algorithms for evaluation.

The web app features:

- A visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
- Integration with a robust backend.
- Deployment of a database on Heroku and an image library on GitHub Pages.
- Capability to test and measure the effectiveness of recommendation algorithms directly within the app.

The application is deployed at: [Web App Link](https://spec-project-store-recommend-app.streamlit.app/)

This project demonstrates the potential of recommendation systems in a practical setting, offering a streamlined platform for testing, optimizing, and understanding algorithm performance. It is ideal for both developers and researchers looking to innovate in the recommendation space.

The photo data used in this application is hosted on GitHub Pages, providing an easily accessible and scalable solution for serving images. The photos are stored in the repository [JoyJoyWang/yelp_photo](https://github.com/JoyJoyWang/yelp_photo) and can be accessed directly via the GitHub Pages URL. This setup ensures that the application can efficiently fetch and display images without requiring additional image hosting services.

## Python Files and Functions

### 1. `display.py`

Functions for displaying and interacting with the frontend:

- `log_click_event(username, business_id, action)`: Logs user clicks and collections.
- `execute_query(query, params)`: Executes a SQL query and handles exceptions.
- `cold_start_recommendation(username, query_offset, limit)`: Provides recommendations for new users.
- `search_recommendation(search_query, username, query_offset, limit)`: Fetches recommendations based on search queries.
- `display_businesses(search_query, page)`: Displays businesses in a paginated grid layout.
- `display_store_details(businesses)`: Shows detailed information about a specific business.

### 2. `login.py`

Handles user authentication and session management:

- `login()`: Authenticates users using their username and password.
- `register()`: Registers new users and stores their credentials securely.
- `preference_form()`: Allows users to set preferences for better recommendations.
- `check_user_preferences()`: Verifies if a user has set preferences.
- `page_router()`: Manages routing between login, registration, and main pages.

### 3. `recommendation.py`

Implements recommendation algorithms:

- `fetch_businesses_with_keywords(keywords, limit)`: Retrieves businesses matching the provided keywords.
- `recommendation_with_keywords(search_query, username, limit)`: Combines user preferences and search queries to generate recommendations.
